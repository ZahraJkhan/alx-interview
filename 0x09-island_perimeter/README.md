# 0x09. Island Perimeter
# Concepts Needed:
 ## 2D Arrays (Matrices):

 * Accessing and iterating over elements in a 2D array.
 * Understanding how to navigate through adjacent cells (horizontally and vertically).
## Conditional Logic:

 * Applying conditions to determine whether a cell contributes to the perimeter of the island.
## Counting Techniques:

Developing a method to count the edges that contribute to the islandâ€™s perimeter.
## Problem-Solving Strategies:

Breaking down the problem into smaller tasks, such as identifying land cells and calculating their contribution to the perimeter.
## Python Programming:

 * Nested loops for iterating over grid cells.
 * Conditional statements to check the status of adjacent c
